# 🧠 Computer Science Course Training

This repository is a personal, structured training ground for key Computer Science topics, implemented hands-on in JavaScript. It covers fundamental data structures, memory management principles, asynchronous and reactive programming, functional abstractions (like monads and functors), parser combinators, and more.

## 📁 Project Overview

Each file in this repo focuses on a particular topic from CS theory, implemented in code to reinforce conceptual understanding and algorithmic thinking.

### ✅ Covered Topics

#### 1. **Core Data Structures & Memory Mechanics**

> `Core Data Structures & Memory Mechanics.js`

- Stack & Heap explanation with simulation
- Primitive vs reference types in memory
- Manual object lifecycle examples
- Low-level mechanics behind arrays and objects in JS

#### 2. **Doubly Linked List & ArrayBuffer**

> `Dubly Linked List & Array Buffer.js`

- Manual implementation of a doubly linked list
- Memory-efficient representation using `ArrayBuffer` and `DataView`
- Binary-level memory manipulation and pointer logic in JavaScript

#### 3. **Container Types**

> `Container Types.js`

- Implementation and distinction between Option (Maybe), Result, Either containers
- Inspired by functional programming languages like Haskell and Rust
- Examples of error handling, chaining, and immutability

#### 4. **Asynchronous Iterators & Reactive Programming**

> `Asynchronous Iterators & Generators. Reactive Programming technique.js`

- Custom implementation of asynchronous iterables
- Reactive event streams and pipeline composition
- `for-await-of`, push-pull paradigms, and operator chaining

#### 5. **Generators, Parsers & Parser Combinators**

> `Generators, Parsers, Parser Combinators (compositions).js`

- Token stream parsing using generators
- Simple parser combinators from scratch
- Composition-first design (map, flatMap, sequence, alt)
- Great intro to building language processors or DSLs

#### 6. **Monads & Functors**

> `Monads & Functors.js`

- Pure JS implementation of monads, functors, and applicatives
- Identity, Maybe, IO-like examples
- Composition through `map`, `chain`, `flatMap`
- Comparison with traditional imperative patterns
